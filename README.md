## Acknowledgments

The GitHub repository of [Tailwind CSS docs](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com) helped me a lot to get insights into how to self-host fonts, and their [Spotlight template](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/spotlight) was the first inspiration for building this site.
