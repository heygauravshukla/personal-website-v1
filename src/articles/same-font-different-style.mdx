I’m not a designer.

But just because you're a developer doesn’t mean your typography has to be boring.

So when I used the Inter font on my site and it looked kind of… flat, I figured I’d just messed up the spacing or weights.

Then I came across another portfolio that used Inter — and it looked amazing.

Same font. Totally different vibe.

## The Typography Problem No One Talks About

I was confused.

How can the exact same font look so much better on someone else’s site?

I dug into it and noticed something subtle but important:

The letter **“a”** was shaped differently.

On my site, it was the traditional double-storey “a.”
On theirs, it was a rounder, simpler single-storey version.

## Fonts Have Hidden Glyphs (And You Can Unlock Them)

Turns out fonts don’t just have weights and spacing.
They also have alternate versions of characters — called **glyphs**.

The Inter font includes a bunch of these variations.
But they’re not enabled by default.

To unlock them, you can use this CSS:

```css
font-feature-settings: <feature-tag-value>;
```

Here `<feature-tag-value>` represents a space-separated tuple consisting of a tag name and an optional value.

For example, to enable the single-storey “a”, you can use:

```css
font-feature-settings: "ss07";
```

This tells the browser to render a different version of the character — in this case, the modern single-storey “a.”

You can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings).

## Why It Didn’t Work for Me at First

I tried the CSS, but nothing changed.

That’s when I realized: I was using `next/font/google` from Next.js — and Google Fonts **doesn’t support all OpenType features**.

So even though the font was technically Inter, I wasn’t getting the full version.

## The Fix: Self-Hosting the Inter Font

To solve this, I self-hosted the font — and it worked perfectly.

Here’s how I did it:

### 1. Download the Font

From the official [Inter GitHub repo](https://github.com/rsms/inter), I grabbed:

- `InterVariable.woff2`
- `InterVariable-Italic.woff2`

### 2. Add to Your Project

Placed both files in:

```
/src/app/fonts/
```

### 3. Use `next/font/local`

In `layout.tsx`, I imported the font like this:

```tsx
import localFont from "next/font/local";

const inter = localFont({
  src: [
    {
      path: "./fonts/InterVariable.woff2",
      weight: "100 900",
      style: "normal",
    },
    {
      path: "./fonts/InterVariable-Italic.woff2",
      weight: "100 900",
      style: "italic",
    },
  ],
  variable: "--font-inter",
});
```

### 4. Set the Font Feature

Then in global CSS:

```css
html {
  font-feature-settings: "ss07";
}
```

Now the text uses the alternate glyph — and just like that, the font looked cleaner, sharper, and more modern.

## Final Thoughts

I didn’t change the font.

I didn’t tweak a thousand settings.

I just enabled one hidden feature — and it made a big difference.

If you’re a developer like me who cares about details, this is a great trick to level up your typography without becoming a designer.

**Before using this font feature make sure your font supports it.**
