## 🧠 Overview

This project is the **first version of my personal website**, designed to serve as a central hub for my technical portfolio, blog posts, and curated resources. The site is clean, responsive, and optimized for performance — and it's built to scale as I grow.

## 🚀 Goals & Challenges

I aimed to build a site that:

- Communicates my personal brand clearly
- Enables me to share technical insights through blog posts
- Showcases detailed project case studies with code and demos
- Offers a smooth and modern user experience
- Uses a scalable, component-driven architecture
- Includes a reliable, accessible contact system

- **shadcn/ui** – Accessible and composable component library
- **Framer Motion** – For subtle yet smooth animations
- **MDX** – Write content with JSX and Markdown
- **react-hook-form** + **Zod** – Flexible form handling with robust validation
- **EmailJS** – Serverless email handling for contact form submissions
